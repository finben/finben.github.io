We toasted gleefully to that year,
eyes full of light, fleshy hearts beating
lungs pink, fresh air, fearless

Cheers, to another decade of humanity
Sure, we heard, a bat in China,
no need to fear, can't touch us here

Through the months we danced, drunk on life
Spinning -- carousing. Only one, maybe two cases
on a military base across the city

Then everything changed, "Beware the Ides of March"
Shakespeare had warned us, hit by an iceberg in the night
our ironclad ship took on water

Orders went out, easy enough to obey
At first we were good. Like dogs we muzzled up.
It was only a small wave, stay home keep grandma safe

After a week our patience wore thin. Panic set in.
We raided stores, like wolves we hunted shelves
ripped toilet paper from the sanitized hands of our neighbor.

Then we marched back to our castles, to wait
without end, listlessly; Gnawing the nerves
of the other rats trapped - in ever enclosing walls.

We checked the charts; read news like the Bible
How odd, to having been the captain of our fate
we now placed hope like casino chips

Our leaders appeared fools, impotent to save
So we turned to science, begging for a cure
Loved ones began to die, in rooms with doors shut to us

With hatred in our eyes, we began to point fingers
A video went viral, something needed to be done
We were just the ones ready to take action

Stadiums, long closed, we made the streets our Colosseum
Gas masks on, we looted and set fires. We couldn't breathe.
We bashed in glass, strapped with new Nikes.

But we emerged, out of our cocoons
All another year older, emotions jarred
hearts with psychological scars

Still, normal is what normal is
We returned to normal
Hand shakes still seem dangerous now
But we smile again at one another,
through our masks, glad to have gotten through
that year alone.
