This is my humble simple spaghetti splat of who I am and where my interests lie in no particular order of importance. Like many coffee riddled developers, I have found beauty in well architechtured code bases that solve difficult problems. I find energy in living each breath, and generally can't find enough hours in the day to chase the wind in all of the things that I am immensely interested in. Perhaps I feel that I wasted far too much time in my youth and am making up for lost time... That being said, I want to be someone who stops to reflect between ebbing and flowing from one interest to another. The grounding factors that keep me from drifting with the tide are two rocks in my life. That is the steadfast assurance of Jesus my Savior and the down to earth lovely wife Johanna that He provided me with. Simply put, I am grounded by those that which I love the most. One other thing that stays steadfast is my dedication to avoid ennui and monotony even at the cost of keeping life on hard mode. This has cost me a cushy corporate job, a big house, and white picket fence. But the dividends have been enormous and have enriched my life to no end. One wonderful side effect has been becoming a lifelong learner who enjoys learning for it's own sake. Recently I have also been discovering in myself a passion for teaching and mentoring; something which has begun to blossom through tutoring.

As a bit of a Renaissance man, I participate in a sundry of hobbies, with the following list as a representation that is by no means exhaustive: reading, writing, chess, photography, capoira, learning German, and collecting watches.

My intellectual interests are blockchain technologies, philosophy, cryptography, classical literature, education, functional programming, and spirituality.
