This is my humble simple spaghetti splat of who I am at this point in time and a forward looking personal history.

In 2020 I was on my way to move to Frankfurt, Germany when I got stopped in my tracks due to Covid travel restrictions. To make the best of the situation I began to develop a mobile app with a friend and found an enormous interest in software development. Soon, I found myself diving off the deep end and learning everything from data science to cryptocurrency blockchain networks. These days I find myself in a sea of coffee riddled developers who find beauty in well designed code bases, and optimized algorithms. In my free time I tutor computer science and help the next generation enjoy programming.

While I foresee future ebbs and flows in my interests what will remain steadfast is my dedication to avoid ennui and monotony even at the cost of keeping life on hard mode. This has cost me a cushy corporate job, a big house, and white picket fence. But the dividends have been enormous and have enriched my life to no end. When you constantly throw away what you know the side effect is you stay hungry and become a lifelong learner who enjoys learning for it's own sake.

My current intellectual interests are blockchain technologies, cryptography, philosophy, classical literature, education, functional programming, and spirituality.
